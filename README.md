# SSL-Backdoor

SSL-Backdoor is an academic research library dedicated to exploring **poisoning attacks in self-supervised learning (SSL)**. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and unified platform for researchers to implement, evaluate, and compare various attack and defense mechanisms in the context of SSL.

This library originated as a rewrite of the SSLBKD implementation, ensuring **consistent training protocols** and **hyperparameter fidelity** for fair comparisons. We've since expanded its capabilities significantly.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Unified Poisoning & Training Framework:** Streamlined pipeline for applying diverse poisoning strategies and training SSL models.
2.  **Reproducibility Focus:** Maintains original hyperparameters from benchmark papers (like SSLBKD) to ensure reliable and comparable results.
3.  **Flexible Implementations:** Supports PyTorch Lightning for SimCLR and standard PyTorch for BYOL, MoCo, and SimSiam, offering adaptability to different workflows.
4.  **Enhanced Configuration:** Offers a robust configuration system for fine-grained control over poisoning parameters and training settings.
5.  **Extensibility:** Designed with modularity in mind, making it easier to integrate new attack algorithms, defense methods, and SSL models.

*Future plans include support for multimodal contrastive learning models.*

## üì¢ What's New?

üîÑ **Active Refactoring Underway!** We are currently refactoring the codebase to improve code quality, maintainability, and ease of use. Expect ongoing improvements!

‚úÖ **Current Support:**

*   **Attack Algorithms:** SSLBKD, CTRL, CorruptEncoder, BLTO (inference only)
*   **SSL Methods:** MoCo, SimCLR, SimSiam, BYOL

üõ°Ô∏è **Under Development:**

*   **PatchSearch Defense:** Implementing the PatchSearch method for detecting backdoored samples in SSL models.

Stay tuned for more updates!

## Setup

Get started with SSL-Backdoor quickly:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jsrdcht/SSL-Backdoor.git
    cd SSL-Backdoor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Consider using a virtual environment (`conda`, `venv`, etc.) to manage dependencies.* 

## Usage

### Training an SSL Model on a Poisoned Dataset

To train an SSL model (e.g., using MoCo v2) with a chosen poisoning attack, you can use the provided scripts. Example for Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training:

```bash
# Configure your desired attack, SSL method, dataset, etc. in the relevant config file
# (e.g., configs/ssl/moco_config.yaml, configs/poisoning/...)

bash tools/train.sh <path_to_your_config.yaml>
```

*Please refer to the `configs` directory and specific training scripts for detailed usage and parameter options.*
